// ===== About ===== //
This project uses the OpenAI Api for general Q&A & offers the use of 
a Foodtracker API from Spoonacular.
It serves as a project for working with APIs, asynchronous JavaScript, and basic web development. 

// ===== Getting Started ===== //

Prerequisites:

Get your API-key from Spoonacular by registering for a free account.
Basic JavaScript knowledge (especially working with fetch(), promises, and async/await)
HTML & CSS (to structure and style the page)
A code editor (e.g., VS Code)
Git (for cloning the repository)
Node.js (if dependencies need to be managed)

Concepts You Should Know:
To build a similar project, you should be familiar with:
Fetching data from an API using fetch() or axios
Handling JSON responses and working with objects
Using async/await for asynchronous operations
DOM manipulation to display fetched data dynamically
Event listeners to trigger API calls on user interaction
Basic error handling to manage failed API requests

Installation:

Clone the repository (clone option upper right corner â¬†)
(If applicable) Install dependencies:
sh
npm install

Run the project:
If it's a simple HTML/CSS/JS project, open the HTML file in a browser
If using a local server:
sh
npm start

Hope that helps ðŸ¤— and have fun!
