# Fitness by Claud_S
 Multipage containing Landing page (introduction, services & contact-form), sub-page with exercises and a section to generate 
 healthy recipes with macros through an api (Spoonacular)
 and a third page for Q&A with an integrated chatbot from OpenAI. 

 Website on Fitness, Exercises, Nutrition & my Chat-Bot Sparkle ✨

// ===== About ===== //

This project uses the OpenAI Api for general Q&A & offers the use of 
a Foodtracker API from Spoonacular.
It serves as a project for working with APIs, asynchronous JavaScript, and basic web development. 
Starting of with the main page (index.html). Here you find a section with a personal introduction, followed
by a section about services that can be provided and a simple contact form with client-sided validation.
The sub-page exercises.html gives an impression of sample exercises (both picture & a link to
pocketyoga) and users can generate healthy recipes powered by the API from Sponnacular.
The 2nd sub-page is a customized Chat-Bot which is powered by OpenAi. I wrote a custom
knowledge-base which you can alter to your needs. 
The overall styling is a mixture of calm yet cool colors and energizing content. Each html has its own css and js.
I hope this project can be an inspiration or maybe motivation. 🍀✨

// ===== Getting Started ===== //

Prerequisites:

✨ Get your API-key from Spoonacular by registering for a free account.
✨ You will also need an API-key from OpenAI (https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Create a free account & create new secret key. 
    Store  it safely because YOU CAN ONLY SEE IT ONCE!
✨ Basic JavaScript knowledge (especially working with fetch(), promises, and async/await)
✨ HTML & CSS (concecpts like e.g. flexbox/ grid, to structure and style the page)
✨ Accessibility Standards WCAG (silktide has a grad browser based extensions for live checks while you build your page)
✨ A code editor (e.g., i used VS Code)
✨ Git (for cloning the repository)
✨ Node.js (if dependencies need to be managed, API-key storage backend-side)

🌱 Concepts You Should Know:

To build a similar project, you should be familiar with:
Fetching data from an API using fetch() or axios
Handling JSON responses and working with objects
Using async/await for asynchronous operations
DOM manipulation to display fetched data dynamically
Event listeners to trigger API calls on user interaction
Basic error handling to manage failed API requests

🌱 Installation/ Copy the code:

The easiest way is to:
Clone the repository (clone option upper right corner ⬆)
(If applicable) Install dependencies:
sh
npm install

or if you're just getting started: 
copy the code from each file manually and paste it to your corresponding file in your editor.

🌱 Run the project:

It's a simple HTML/CSS/JS project, open the HTML file in a browser like Chrome or Firefox (right click on index.html and 
either copy path -> insert in browser or via Live Server (a VS Code Extension))
If using a local server:
sh
npm start

Hope that helps 🤗 and have fun!
