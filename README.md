# Fitness by Claud_S
 Multipage with intro. exercises, chatbot & api for food recipes

 Website on Fitness, Exercises, Nutrition & my Chat-Bot Sparkle ‚ú®

// ===== About ===== //

This project uses the OpenAI Api for general Q&A & offers the use of 
a Foodtracker API from Spoonacular.
It serves as a project for working with APIs, asynchronous JavaScript, and basic web development. 
Starting of with the main page (index.html). Here you find a section with a personal introduction, followed
by a section about services that can be provided and a simple contact form.
The sub-page exercises.html gives an impression of sample exercises (both picture & a link to
pocketyoga) and users can generate healthy recipes powered by the API from Sponnacular.
The 2nd sub-page is a customized Chat-Bot which is powered by OpenAi. I wrote a custom
knowledge-base which you can alter to your needs. 
The overall styling is a mixture of calm colors and bubbly-content. Each html has its own css and js.
I hope this project can be of inspiration or maybe motivation. üçÄ‚ú®

Basic JavaScript knowledge (especially working with fetch(), promises, and async/await)
HTML & CSS (to structure and style the page)
Accessibility Standards WCAG
A code editor (e.g., i used VS Code)
Git (for cloning the repository)
Node.js (if dependencies need to be managed)

Concepts You Should Know:
To build a similar project, you should be familiar with:
Fetching data from an API using fetch() or axios
Handling JSON responses and working with objects
Using async/await for asynchronous operations
DOM manipulation to display fetched data dynamically
Event listeners to trigger API calls on user interaction
Basic error handling to manage failed API requests

Installation:

Clone the repository (clone option upper right corner ‚¨Ü)
(If applicable) Install dependencies:
sh
npm install

Run the project:
If it's a simple HTML/CSS/JS project, open the HTML file in a browser
If using a local server:
sh
npm start

Hope that helps ü§ó and have fun!
